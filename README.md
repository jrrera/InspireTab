# InspireTab

InspireTab is a Chrome extension that I (Jon) use to block certain websites
during the day.

At the moment it can:

 * Block a list of websites of your choosing.
 * Allow you a free pass into that website if it's actually productive, or you're on break.
 * Supports custom images to display in the background -- this adds additional inspiration to be productive.

At the moment, you cannot customize the images and websites from the UI. It's hardcoded. Customization coming soon!
